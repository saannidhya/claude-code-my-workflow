# 03: RQ2 — The family lock: post-transfer time to market sale
# Author: Saani Rawat
# Purpose: For 2008-2018 transfer cohorts, measure time from event to the
#          property's NEXT arm's-length market sale. Kaplan-Meier survival
#          by event class with right-censoring at 2024-06-30 (last full
#          month of data). Descriptive: selection is the object of interest.
# Inputs:  data/derived/03_family_homes/events.parquet
# Outputs: _outputs/tables/hazard_sold_within.csv
#          _outputs/tables/hazard_km_curves.csv
#          _outputs/hazard_summary.rds
